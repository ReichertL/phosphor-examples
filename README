This simple project is meant to be a series of example showing how to use
Phosphor. Bear in mind that I created this in the process of learning
how to use Phosphor myself, so there are bound to be mistakes/inefficiencies in the examples.
These are solely my responsibility and should not be viewed as a reflection of anyone elses work.

Assuming you have built Phosphor, and instrumented a JRE at jre-inst, you can run
the examples here by

mvn package (creates jar with examples)
and then running

./run_examples.sh <folder-instrumented-jre-and-phosphor-jar>
(see ./run_examples.sh -h  for more details)

(I'm sure there is a nicer way of doing this with maven... but I'm not as familiar with it,
so feel free to modify and put in a PR if you are)

If you'd like to read along with the notes I made for this project, run
`mvn latex:latex` which creates a pdf report at target/site/notes.pdf
